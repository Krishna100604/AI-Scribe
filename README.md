<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

About the Project

"AI Scribe is" an innovative web platform designed to provide users with captivating short stories generated by artificial intelligence. This platform leverages cutting-edge AI technology to turn user-provided story prompts into engaging narratives. Here's how it works:

### Core Functionality
Story Prompt Submission: Users can input story prompts, which serve as the creative spark for the AI model.
AI-Generated Stories: The platform utilizes a state-of-the-art text generation model, such as GPT-3 or GPT-4 from OpenAI, to create short stories based on the provided prompts.
Story Display and Interaction: Generated stories are displayed in an attractive format, allowing users to read, save, and share them.
Upvoting System: Users can upvote their favorite stories, and these top-voted stories are prominently featured on a leaderboard.

### Technology Stack
The AI Story Generator is built using a modern technology stack to ensure a seamless user experience:

- Frontend: The user interface is developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building interactive web applications. [![React][React.js]][React-url]
- Backend: The backend infrastructure is powered by Node.js, providing the necessary server capabilities. [![Node.js][NodeJS]][NodeJS-url]
- Database: User data, generated stories, and upvotes are stored securely in a MongoDB database, ensuring data persistence. [![MongoDB][MongoDB]][MongoDB-url]
- OpenAI API Integration: The heart of the project lies in the integration of the OpenAI API. This API interacts with the text generation model, fine-tuned specifically for short story generation.
- Efficient Resource Management: The platform incorporates resource management techniques to handle the computational demands of AI text generation efficiently. This may include setting word limits or employing asynchronous processing for scalability.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Follow these instruction to setup the project into your local machine

### Prerequisites

Before you can run the "Task Unity" software, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

* **Node.js**: "Task Unity" relies on Node.js for server-side operations. If you don't have Node.js installed, you can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

  To check if you have Node.js installed, open your terminal and run:
  
  ```sh
  node -v
  ```
  If Node.js is not installed, please follow the link to download and install it.

* **npm (Node Package Manager)**: Ensure you have the latest npm version by running:

  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g 
  ```

* **MongoDB**: Download and install MongoDB from [mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com/).

  ```sh
  mongod --version
  ```

Once you have these prerequisites in place, you'll be ready to run "Task Unity" and experience efficient task management and collaboration.

### Installation

_Below are the instructions of how you can install and set up your app._

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Mdkaif-123/Task-Unity.git
   ```

2. Cd into the backend folder
   ```sh
   cd ./Backend
   ```

3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

4. Cd into the frontend folder
   ```sh
   cd ./frontend
   ```

5. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

6. Set up your backend .env file
   ```js
   MONGO_DB_URL = "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/taskUnityDB"
   AUTH_SECRET_KEY = "thisistheauthsecretkeyforauthenticationpurpose"
   ```

7. Set up your frontend .env file
   ```js
   REACT_APP_HOST="http://localhost:8000"
   ```
